		<h2> Who made this website? </h2>
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty boring guy and computer science undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico at Bayam&oacute;n by the name of Emanuel Correa Rivera.</p>

		<h2> Why did you make this website? </h2>
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I love music, its a huge part of my life, and I feel like I have to honor all the albums that have completely blown my mind.  I also like to write from time to time, so I thought it would be idea to write about something I bother a lot of my friends with.  I hope you appreciate all the hard work I've put into the site.</p>

		<h2> How can I contact you? </h2>
