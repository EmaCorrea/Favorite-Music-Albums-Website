	<h2> What is P3P? </h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) enables Websites to express their privacy practices in a standard format that can be retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by user agents. P3P user agents will allow users to be informed of site practices (in both machine- and human-readable formats) and to automate decision-making based on these practices when appropriate. Thus users need not read the privacy policies at every site they visit. Have a look at the list of P3P software. </p>

<h2> Why is P3P useful? </h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P3P uses machine readable descriptions to describe the collection and use of data. Sites implementing such policies make their practises explicit and thus open them to public scrutiny. Browsers can help the user to understand those privacy practises with smart interfaces. Most importantly, Browsers can this way develop a predictable behavior when blocking content like cookies thus giving a real incentive to eCommerce sites to behave in a privacy friendly way. This avoids the current scattering of cookie-blocking behaviors based on individual heuristics imagined by the implementer of the blocking tool which will make the creation of stateful services on the web a pain because the state-retrievel will be unpredictable.</p>

<h2> How it works</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P3P enables Web sites to translate their privacy practices into a standardized, machine-readable format (Extensible Markup Language XML) that can be retrieved automatically and easily interpreted by a user's browser. Translation can be performed manually or with automated tools. Once completed, simple server configurations enable the Web site to automatically inform visitors that it supports P3P.

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the user side, P3P clients automatically fetch and read P3P privacy policies on Web sites. A user's browser equipped for P3P can check a Web site's privacy policy and inform the user of that site's information practices. The browser could then automatically compare the statement to the privacy preferences of the user, self-regulatory guidelines, or a variety of legal standards from around the world. P3P client software can be built into a Web browser, plug-ins, or other software. </p>
